# github.highcharts.com
[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

Node.js server which runs a RESTful application to serve requested Highcharts distribution files for a given version. Used for testing purposes only. 

## Install
Open a CLI and navigate to where you would like to install the application.

Clone the repository and install required dependencies by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/highcharts/github.highcharts.com.git
cd github.highcharts.com
npm install
```

### Configure settings
The application requires a configuration file `./config.json` to be able to run. All possible configuration options is listed below.

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| informationLevel | The level of severity of the information outputted to the log. The severity can be 0 (everything), 1 (warnings and errors), 2 (only errors). Defaults to 2. |
| port | The port the server application will listen to. Defaults to 80. |
| secureToken | The secret token used to validate the GitHub webhook post to /update. See [GitHub Developer - Securing your webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/) for more information. |
| token | Personal access token used to gain access to GitHub API. The token scope is requires only access to public repositories. See [GitHub Help - Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) for more information. |

Example config file:
```json
{
    "informationLevel": 0,
    "port": 90,
    "token": "token",
    "secureToken": "secureToken"
}
```

## Run the application
Open a CLI and run the command: `npm start`

Open `http://localhost:80` in a browser and you should see the index page of the app.
It is possible to configure which port the application listens to, see [Configure settings](#configure-settings).

## Code documentation
Each file contains a descriptive header, mentioning its author, purpose and so on. Every function should contain a descriptive JSDoc header.

### File Structure
| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| app | Contains all the application JS code. |
| assets | Contains assets like CSS, images, etc. |
| scripts | Tooling scripts used for deployment and such. Should not be deployed with the application. |
| test | Contains all the unit-tests for the application. Should not be deployed with the application. |
| tmp | Where the temporary files used in the application is written. |
| views | Where the HTML files are located. |

## Update the Highcharts assembler
Open a CLI and run the following command to install an updated version of the assembler:
```
npm install highcharts/highcharts-assembler#<tag>
```
Then update the version number in package.json, as normal when there is an important change.
Commit the changes to Github, and continue on to deployment.

## Deployment
Before deploying a new application, please ensure the following requirements are met.
### Requirements
1. Version number in `package.json` must have been updated since last deployment. See [Update version](#update-version).
2. Any updates must be committed to ensure the running application is tracked.
3. `config.json` is configured according to requirements. See [Configure settings](#configure-settings).

### Update version
Version number must be updated to keep track of which version of the application is currently in production, and which version will be eventually deployed.

Run `npm version [patch|minor|major]` to bump the version.
Then run `git push && git push --tags` to publish the new version to the GitHub repository.

### Packaging
Open a CLI and run the following command:
`npm run build`
The application will be packed into an archive named `github.highcharts-<version>.zip`. The zip is ready to be uploaded and unpacked on your server.

## Nice to know
The files are downloaded via GitHub Contents API and stored in a local folder per branch/tag/ref the first time a particular branch/tag/ref is requested. For every subseqent request the local version will be used, which, means that the state of a particular branch won't be updated unless the application is redeployed.

When fetching newer version the downloaded contents are checked for the presence of a ts config - and if found it will run an additional step for compiling the files to Javascript.

For bundling master files, or custom files the `highcharts-assembler` is used.  

### Troubleshooting
The temporary folder `tmp/` folder may become bloated or have a partial state if something goes wrong. This may cause unexpected behaviour. If you experience something similar then try to delete everything in the  `tmp/` folder and retry your request.
